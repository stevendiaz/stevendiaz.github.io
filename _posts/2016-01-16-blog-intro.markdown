### Goals of this blog

I made this blog in hopes of documenting my experiences, thoughts, 
and projects in one place. What better to than to host a blog with
your own website? This is also an exercise in keeping my writing 
skills sharp. It's been two semesters since I've taken a writing 
course and I would rather not see my writing skills decay. 


Expect all types of subjects, from techincal projects that I'm
working on, to interesting or notable experiences in my life. The
goal is to be able to look back on this blog and reflect on my 
college career and my growth as an individual. 

### The semester ahead: CS439
As a freshman entering Computer Science at UT, I had the benefit
of having access to upperclassmen in the same program via my envolvement
with [Texas LAN](http://texaslan.org). Some of the benefits of this were tips on
career advancement, landing that first internship, and guidance on 
what to expect on the classes ahead. One particular class was mentioned
many many more times than any of the others. That class was CS439, otherwise
known as Operating Systems, OS, PintOS, etc. This is the last sequence
in our Systems cirriculum and widely regarded as one of the hardest required
classes in the department. 


An interesting culture has developed around this class. Our computer lab is sometimes
packed to the brim with OS teams (usually 2-4 people) when project deadlines
come close. There are _celebrations_ for those who finish the course. 
Ask an OS student what they did this weekend, and if the answer is "PintOS", 
it's met with a comforting head nod before you continue describing
your weekend because you know that was _all they did_. It's become the
'right of passage' for students in the CS department. 


So imagine young, freshman Steven. Struggling with his Intro to Programming
problems and questioning his ability to succeed in this department. Not only
do I eventually have to overcome this obstacle, but I have to do it SOON. Most
students usually take it in their fourth semester, as sophomores. I knew it would
come sooner than I thought, and I was correct. After I watched three semesters
fly by, I sit at the doorstep of the biggest challenge in my academic career. 


Last semester, I took the predecessor to Operating 
Systems, CS429: Computer Architecture. This course is no easy feat either, but I 
felt like I excelled in this course despite the challenging tests and lengthy projects. 
Over the past semesters, I've worked on limiting the effects of [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). My attitude towards this class has taken a shift over the past semester.
Not only am I confident that I can get through this course, _I'm excited about it_. 
And I think that's the best attitude to have. See something challenging? Get excited
about it and take it one step at a time. It doesn't help to be anxious, nervous, or 
worried because that only distracts your abilities to complete the task in front of 
you. I'm approaching this with a clear head and I'm ready to tackle it.
