I'm a junior at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm majoring 
in computer science with a certificate in business. 
I'm all about building cool things, meeting new people, and solving interesting problems.
Outside of class I organize social events as the Social Chair for [Texas LAN](texaslan.org).
I previously served as the Service Chair, where I worked with CoderDojo in [Round Rock](http://coderdojorr.weebly.com/).


Last summer I was a Software Development Intern at [Direct Energy](https://www.directenergy.com).
I'm currently a Software Engineer Intern at [Nokia](https://www,nokia.com)
