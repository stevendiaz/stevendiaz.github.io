I'm a junior at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm majoring 
in computer science with a certificate in business. 
I'm all about building cool things, meeting new people, and solving interesting problems.
Outside of class I organize social events as the Social Chair for [Texas LAN](http://texaslan.org).
I previously served as the Service Chair, where I worked with CoderDojo in [Round Rock](http://coderdojorr.weebly.com/).

The past two summers I've worked as an intern for [Direct Energy](https://www.directenergy.com) and [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com).
I'm currently a Software Engineer for [Gitty, Inc.](https://gitty.xyz). I'll be spending this Summer in San Francisco at [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com).
