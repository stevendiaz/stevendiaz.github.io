I'm a sophomore at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm majoring 
in computer science with a certificate in business. I'm all about building cool things, meeting new people, and solving interesting problems.


Last summer I was a Software Development Intern at [Direct Energy](https://www.directenergy.com). I'm currently looking for an internship for Summer 2016.
