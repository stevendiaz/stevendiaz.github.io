My experiences teaching kids how to code

- Gender isn't a factor
- They're just like us, they like to build cool stuff.
- Anecdote about teaching kids what loops are
- Kids are creative, and they bring interesting ideas into programming. 
- programming as a form of expression

Title: ???/ 

Coming out of my freshman year, 

I wasn't ever exposed to programming until I was a sophomore in high school, but even then, the Computer Science class wasn't ever taken seriously. It was seen as a blow off (image that) and the small UIL Computer Science team that was formed was never given the exposure it deserves. But I soon realized that even _I_ was lucky to have gone to a high school with even a basic programming class. 

When I came into my position as the Service Chair for Texas LAN, I knew that STEM outreach was something that I wanted to implement, but I didn't really know what that entailed. After some poking around in Google and following suggestions from friends, I heard of an organization called Coderdojo, I offered to help get CS students to volunteer on sundays. 
Soon, I was at CoderDojo every weekend I could. I began to learn some amazing things about how kids learn and how social barriers can prevent us from reaching out and exploring topics we might have interest in. 

An amazing tidbit about this group of kids was the gender ratio. In the bundle of 20 kids, it was almost even, with about 11 boys and 9 girls. Now if you're a computer science major, this might suprise you. You walk into your CS class only to find about 5 to 10 girls in a class room of 90 people. Simply put, and to no ones suprise: _gender isn't a factor in how much you love to build cool stuff_. 

A cool byproduct of teaching kids how to code is getting better at teaching kids how to code. When approaching concepts, I've picked up patterns on what works and what doesn't when trying to get an idea into a kids mind.
 A common problem I'll find is that the student will give the computer the correct instructions but it won't work because those instructions aren't being executing continuously.
 A loop is a critical concept in programming and the solution to this problem. 
The first time, 
I explain to them what a loop is and why it solves this problem.
 The next time, I ask how a loop could be applied to this problem. 
Usually this is all it takes before they're writing their own loops or applying loops to different problems.
 This is probably the most rewarding aspect of teaching kids programming. Seeing them internalize concepts _and_ get excited about building things is all I could ever ask for.

Let me be clear, my goal is not to recruit the next class of CS majors.
